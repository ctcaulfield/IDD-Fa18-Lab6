# ChatBot

*A lab report by Christopher Caulfield*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**
The only significant code changes I made was in the "bot(data, socket, questionNum)" function. I added a few more condition statements to help me determine if the user typed the correct or wrong answer. I also did some changing in the background color for each question. 


## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
